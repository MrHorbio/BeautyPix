# BeautyPix
Beautypix is an essential tool for bug hunters and cybersecurity experts. It offers several features designed to simplify the process of finding and documenting security issues. Here’s a summary of its main functions:
### Screenshot Capture for Subdomains and Domains:
Beautypix allows bug hunters to capture high-resolution screenshots of both individual subdomains and entire domains. This feature is crucial for documenting vulnerabilities, visualizing security issues, or providing evidence of findings to clients or team members.

### DNS Resolution: 
The tool’s DNS resolution feature enables users to swiftly resolve domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. This capability is essential for identifying potential attack vectors, verifying domain configurations, and ensuring that subdomains are correctly mapped.

### File Merge:
Beautypix’s file merge functionality simplifies the process of combining multiple files into a single document. Whether consolidating logs, reports, or other data sources, this feature helps bug hunters efficiently manage and analyze their findings in a streamlined format.

### OTP Generator:
